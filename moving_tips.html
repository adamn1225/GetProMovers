    <h1 align=center>How to prepare for the big day.</h1><br>
    <p><strong>You've booked your moving company, set a move date, and you think you're ready for the big day. Now what? Here are a few helpful hints on everything you need to prepare before your moving company arrives.</strong></p><br>
      <h3>Clean</h3>
      <p>A few weeks before your move date, commit yourself to tackling one cleaning project per day. For example, start with your bedroom. Clean out your drawers and closet, and donate any items that you won't wear again (hint: If you haven't worn something in the past year, you won't wear it again). Not only will cleaning lighten the load for your movers, but you'll save money on packing materials and associated labor costs.</p><br>
      <h3>Purchase Packing Supplies</h3>
      <p>Unless you're purchasing packing supplies directly from your moving company, you'll want to stock up on boxes, bubble wrap, Sharpies, and packing tape long before moving day. You'll probably need more packing supplies than you think, so anticipate a few runs to the packing supply store (or a few shipments from Amazon).</p><br>
      <h3>Label Boxes Wisely</h3>
      <p> If you're packing everything yourself (as opposed to leaving it to the movers), be sure to label your boxes in mover speak! For example, label every moving box with the room in your new home that the box belongs in. Also, label which boxes contain fragile items by writing "FRAGILE" clearly on all sides of the box, and write "LOAD LAST" on boxes that you'll need immediately. Your movers will thank you!</p><br>
      <h3>Check in With Your Moving Company</h3>
      <p>Call your moving company to review the origination-to-destination plan and schedule before moving day. Make sure that both you and the agent in charge of your move have the correct moving date and any contact information that you'll need to reach one another. Trust us – it'll save you from last-minute moving days gone awry! </p><br>
      <h3>Prepare Your Appliances</h3>
      <p>Believe it or not, moving companies will not disconnect your appliances – like your refrigerator, your washer/dryer, or anything connected to a major utility – for you. To save time on moving day, be sure to disconnect your appliances in advance.</p><br>
      <h3>Pack a "First Night" Box</h3>
      <p>This box, included in your "load last" boxes, will contain things that you'll need to make your first night at your new home easy and comfortable. You'll need things like cleaning supplies, a new shower curtain, pillows/blankets/bed sheets/towels, toothbrushes, toilet paper, and a first aid kit, just in case!</p><br>
      <h3>Gather Important Paperwork... and Keep It in a Safe Place!</h3>
      <p>Most moving companies recommend that you keep important paperwork like your birth certificate or Social Security card directly on your person on moving day, rather than the back of the moving truck. Here are a few key items to keep an eye out for:</p><br>
      <p><strong>Bill of lading</strong></p>
      <p><strong>High-value inventory form</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Lease/mortgage documents for your new and old addresses</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Drivers licenses and passports</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Birth certificates and Social Security cards</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle registration and auto insurance information</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Medical records/kids' doctor's office contact information</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Find more instructions on how to pack your important paperwork here.</strong></p>
      <h3>Have a Plan for Kids and Pets</h3>
      <p>On moving day, make sure that you have a plan to keep your kids and pets out of the way of the movers. It'll ensure that no one gets hurt, and that the movers can efficiently and effectively get the job done.</p><br>
