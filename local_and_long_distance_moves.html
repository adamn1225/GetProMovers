    <h1 align=center>How to Find the Best Movers for Your Long Distance Relocation</h1><br>
    <p>Relocating to another city or state can be daunting enough without the added stress of worrying about how to get your possessions there too. Moving your home across the country is expensive and your possessions are at a greater risk because of
      the distance they will need to travel.</p><br>
    <h2 align=center>Getting Professionals for Long Distance Moving</h2><br>
    <p><strong>The logistics behind a long distance need to be tackled by professionals and here is how you can find the best long distance movers in your area.</strong></p><br>
      <p>Look for properly licensed and adequately insured moving companies that have experience in the
        routes your possessions will be moved.</p><br>
      <p>They must inspect your home and possessions to give you an accurate moving estimate which is
        for free. This cannot be done over the phone or over e-mail.</p><br>
      <p>Get at least 3 quotations that take into account any possible problems that your home may cause
        on moving day. This may include narrow corridors, lots of staircases, broken elevator and fragile items that will need special packing and moving techniques.</p><br>
      <p>This is the right time to ask any questions and to get any other information.</p><br>
      <p>The estimate of the long distance relocation must be handed to you in writing after the
        inspection.</p><br>
    <h2 align=center>Choosing a Reputable and Reliable Mover</h2><br>
    <p><strong>Now that you have the estimates from the movers in your hand you will need to choose the one that will be affordable, yet reputable and reliable enough to undertake your long distance relocation.</strong></p><br>
    <p>Choosing the most reputable company of these is much easier than you think. You can ask family
and friends and look up reviews online. Usually long distance movers with an excellent reputation within an area are well known.</p><br>
    <p>Check the USDOT website where all long distance movers are licensed with the U.S. Government.
The company that you choose should be recorded there and you will also be able to see if they have any special awards.</p><br>
    <p>Price should not be the only deciding factor for your long distance move. Take a closer look at the estimate to see if it includes disassembling and reassembling, custom crating, packing and unpacking, hoisting and temporary storage if needed. These can be expensive extras if not already added on. If an estimate is too good to be true, there may be fraud involved.</p><br>
    <p>Finally, the choice is up to you and your instincts which will lead you to make the choice of the company that you feel will make the long distance relocation work best for you.</p>

      <h1>How to Move Homes Locally at a Minimal Cost to Your Pocket and Stress Level</h1>
      <p>When the need for a local move arises, there are quite a few options available, depending on how much money, time and stress you are willing to fork out. The options include: borrowing a truck and a few friends to help pack, load and carry; renting a truck and doing the rest yourself; hiring a portable storage unit, packing everything in and having it hauled to your new home, or hiring a moving company.</p>
      <p>The pros of doing things yourself include saving money, but the cons include that it can take a lot longer than anticipated, the workload falls on you alone and the costs of buying packaging materials and hiring a rental truck or storage unit has to be taken into account</p><br>
      <h2>Why Hire a Moving Company to Move Locally?</h2>
      <p>A professional moving company will not only take your belongings from your old place to your new, but at an extra cost it will also pack your boxes and unpack them on arrival. This will entail that you have less stress and save time on packing and moving everything yourself.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Pros of hiring professional movers:</strong></p>
      <p>You do less work</p>
      <p>You don't do any of the heavy lifting</p>
      <p>Your belongings are insured for the move</p><br>
      <h2>What will a moving company charge?</h2>
      <p>1. The basic cost is usually based on the weight of your cargo or most often for local moves it is a charge per hour.</p>
      <p>2. Moving companies do have liability coverage for the event of a theft, fire, etc. but if you want more comprehensive protection for damaged or lost items you will have to purchase full-value insurance from them or an insurance company.</p>
      <p>3.When you get a quotation from the movers ensure that the cost covers any extra services needed like a smaller truck, conveyer, special packaging for fragile, and so forth.</p>
      <p>4. When totaling up the costs remember to add a tip for each of the members of the moving crew.</p>
      <p>It is worth your time to get an estimate from a local moving company before deciding to do it yourself. It may not be as expensive as you initially thought when you factor in the benefits!</p>
